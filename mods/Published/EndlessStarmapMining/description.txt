[h1]Endless Starmap Mining[/h1]
This mod multiplies the mass and mass regeneration rate of every space POI that you can mine with a drillcone and the internal storage of diamond for the drillcone, allowing for non stop harvesting of resources.

Default multipliers (can be customized in menu): 
 - 10 for the space POIs
 - 2 for the drillcone

Future plans:
- increase the storage of all rocket cargo modules
