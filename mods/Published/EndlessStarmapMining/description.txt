[h1]Endless Starmap Mining[/h1]
This mod multiplies the mass and mass regeneration rate of every space POI that you can mine with a drillcone, allowing for non stop harvesting of resources.

Default multiplier: 10, can be customized in menu.

Future plans:
- increase the storage of drillcone allowing for more resources to be gathered per trip
- increase the storage of all rocket cargo modules
