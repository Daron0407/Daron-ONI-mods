[h1]Configurable Steam Turbine[/h1]
This mod adds multiple config options for steam turbine such as:
[list]
 [*] wattage production
 [*] minimum steam temperature
 [*] maximum steam temperature
 [*] water output temperature
 [*] self heating amount
 [*] water to turbine heat conversion rate
 [*] difference beetween output water temperature and "turbine too hot" treshold
 [*] steam consumption/water production  rate
[/list]

Every steam turbine also gets a slider to control output temperature per turbine

This mod is safe to use on existing saves and uninstalling this mod reverts all it's changes back to vanilla.
