Liquid Cooler: Built with 400 kg refined metal and 100 kg fullerene


This mod provides lag friendly way to cool your base.
Coolers need fullerene to be built so you're not unlocking any possibilities earlier, they're just another option.

This mod is safe to use on existing saves.
Deconstruct all built coolers before uninstalling this mod.
