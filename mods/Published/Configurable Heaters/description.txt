You can adjust the target temperature for space heater and liquid tepedizer
You can also adjust heating and wattage cost for liquid tepedizer. Heating/wattage controls for space heater have been reworked in the newest patch and are harder to change.


This mod is safe to use on existing saves and uninstalling this mod reverts all it's changes back to vanilla.
