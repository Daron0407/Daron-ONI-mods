[h1]No Puft Prince[/h1]
Have you ever tried to build a puft farm but were quickly stoped by how complicated puft reproduction mechanics are?
Fear no more as this mod removes puft prince and all it's weirdness from the game!

[b]Changes:[/b]
Every Puft variant starts with 80% chance of laying eggs of the same variant and 10% chance to lay either one of remaining two variants. (And 0% chance to lay prince puft egg)
These rates don't change ever

[b]This mod will not remove existing puft princes or change existing reproduction chances, but will affect every puft that will hatch afterwards[/b]
